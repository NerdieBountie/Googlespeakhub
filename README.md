# The Unknown Product — Google Voice Case Study

Most digital products are designed to be seen.  
Google Voice is the opposite.

This project documents Google Voice as an **invisible infrastructure product** — a user-owned communication identity layer that hides in the background and powers communication across devices and channels.

---

## What this product represents

Google Voice is not a feature.

It is a universal phone identity that is:

- cloud-based  
- cross-device  
- persistent across SIMs, countries and hardware changes

Traditional phone numbers are owned by carriers.  
**Google Voice flipped that model — the phone number belongs to the user.**

---

## Why it matters

We live in multiple apps, multiple devices, multiple countries.

Communication is fragmented.

This model solves it by anchoring identity to the user account — not the SIM card.

---

## Who this product is for

- people who switch devices/SIMs often  
- people who want privacy via ephemeral or masked numbers  
- anyone who wants voicemail, calls, texts in one unified feed  
- global workers, remote teams, frequent travelers

---

## Key features studied

- cloud phone number that follows the user
- call routing rules (logic similar to Zapier)
- unified inbox (sms + call logs + voicemail transcript)
- insights on communication behaviour

---

## What this repo contains

- a simplified product narrative  
- a logical system architecture model  
- a conceptual UX mockup structure  

This is a strategic conceptual study of voice as infrastructure — not “just” a voice app UI.
