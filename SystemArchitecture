# System Architecture — Google Voice as Infrastructure

This architecture abstracts Google Voice into 4 programmable layers.

---

## Layer Model

| Layer Name | Description | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity Layer | User-owned phone number anchored to Google Account | Auth+User ID | Virtual phone identity |
| Routing Layer | Rules & logic for how calls/SMS are handled | Voice/SMS event | Forward, filter, voicemail, auto-label |
| Interface Layer | Inbox UI (web/mobile) showing unified feed | Routed events | Transcription, logs, interactions |
| Output Layer | Delivery into external channels | Routed/Processed events | Device ring, Gmail, transcript email |

## System Components

**1) Identity Anchor**
- phone number stored as a digital object
- not tied to hardware / SIM / carrier
- maps to Google Account

**2) Routing Engine**
- event-based rules engine
- inputs: caller ID, region, message type
- outputs: ring device / send to voicemail / forward to inbox

**3) Multi-Channel Inbox**
- feed of SMS + call logs + voicemail transcripts
- interactions: callback, reply SMS, label, archive

**4) Analytics Layer**
- insights: origin of calls, pickup device, channel frequency
- usage: communication footprint understanding

## Data Flow

1. event enters system (call / sms)
2. identity verification maps event → user ID
3. routing rules run
4. action triggered (deliver / forward / voicemail)
5. event stored + displayed in unified inbox
6. analytics model updates behavioural insights

## Technical feasibility reasoning

This model works because:

- user identity is already cloud anchored (Google Account)
- call/SMS events can be abstracted as data events
- routing can be rule-based like serverless functions
- UI layer is simply rendering the processed events
- analytics only needs the event log + metadata

Thus: Google Voice behaves more like **communication plumbing** than an app.
